# Churn Prediction
Churn management seems to be an eternal business problem for most of Telecom operators.  When a subscriber terminate the current service, we call it him a churner. 

Normally we see higher churn rate for prepaid business than for postpaid business. Developing countries also observe higher churn rate than developed countries.  
According to this [blog](http://ipcarrier.blogspot.tw/2015/07/based-on-its-churn-rates-netflix-is-way.html),  even in developed countries like USA, monthly churn rate could go up to 5%. This means that each year, Sprint lose half of all its prepaid subscribers.

Losing customer means huge lost of monthly subscription income. Also operators have to spend more money to win back new customers. Therefore, a good churn management solution is very important to every telecom operator.

## Business Problem
There may be minor differences of defining a churner in different operators. For example one operator may treat those prepaid subscribers who did not use the service for 3 months as already churned. Another operator may define only those who canceled services as churned. You may simply choose a definition consistent to your organization.

Those are the common reasons of churning:
* Customer is unhappy about the previous service provider
* Customer need a new handset.
* Customer is interested with competitor's promotion offer
* Contract expired
* 

We can build a handset life cycle model to calculate new handset opportunity.
