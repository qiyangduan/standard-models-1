Why This Book
=======
If data mining model is a wheel, this wheel has been created too many times.  In my previous career, I have observed people from different orgnizations creating the same data mining models,  over and over again. For many times, they are not even using the latest technologies. For example, churn prediction in telecom is a common problem and most Telecom Carriers wrote their own implementation. When technology evolves (like social, big data), those various in-house models are pretty difficult to upgrade. However, on the other hand, no vendor have created any standard models to tackle this problem. 

Business process can be standardized, so can be data mining models analyzing those business processes. This book will try to provide one standard mining model for each business problem.

This book's mission is to provide one set of business problem definitions and working mining model for each of them. Hopefully, readers do not have creat their own models from scratch.

I will start by a few commonly seen mining models, not to talk about a general idea how to implement, but rather providing a standard product to run the model. Please refer to https://github.com/qiyangduan/stanmo for downloading the models.


# What this book talks about and not talks about
This book will focus on how to build data mining models for each business problem in various industries. 


This book does not talk much about algorithms and theories. Though I spent some time learning theories of each algorithms, like SVM, GMM, etc, I am still no match to those real experts. Therefore, I will only try to apply those algorithms to some real business problems, but not to improve the algorithm from technical point of view. Existing literatures covered this topic quite well. For example, [Pattern matching and Machine Learning (by Christopher Bishop )](http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738) was a good one.

This book does not talk much about technical details. There are many different tools for similar mining jobs, including R, Python (Scikit-Learn), Scala (Spark/MLlib), etc. I will use only Python in this book.
