Why This Book
=======

In my previous career, I have observed people creating same data mining models over and over again, but never satisfied with their work.
Business process can be standardized, so can be data mining models analyzing those business processes.

I will start by a few commonly seen mining models, not to talk about a general idea how to implement, but rather providing a standard product to run the model. Please refer to https://github.com/qiyangduan/stanmo for downloading the models.

What tool to use
=======
When starting a new mining project, the first major decision is which tool or platform to use. Choices are plenty, and there must be one fitting your need. This book will focus on using Python based libraries.
