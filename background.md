When starting a new mining project, the first major decision is which tool or platform to use. Starting from a wrong choice may waste quite some time. 

When I was working on my PhD program, I started from Matlab. The reason was because of a project assignment from the Numerical Optimization class. No doubt that Matlab is a good matrix manipulation and numerical computation language. However its problem is that it is quite expensive, yet not very easy to use.
