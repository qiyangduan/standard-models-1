# Background
When starting a new mining project, the first major decision is which tool or platform to use. Starting from a wrong choice may waste quite some time. 

When I was working on my PhD program, I started from Matlab. The reason was because of a project assignment from the Numerical Optimization class. No doubt that Matlab is a good matrix manipulation and numerical computation language. However its problem is that it is quite expensive, yet not very easy to use.

Choices are plenty, and there must be one fitting your need. This book will focus on using Python based libraries. 

# Open Source vs Commercial
Though people hear Big Data as a fuzzy word, most of times, their data value may not worth the price of a SAS, Matlab or SPSS software license. Not to mention the learning or training cost for any of those. 

Market is ruthless. Because they are proprietary softwares, if they fail in competition, you are in risk of losing your competency. I know quite some old engineers who were master of Infomix, DB2, VisualBasic, etc.   On the contrary, if you master of R or Python, this tool will be with you forever.

I choose only open source technologies.

# Python vs R
First of all, R is awesome. But it's just not my type. 
After a few months, I have a feeling: *Python is for programmers and R is for statisticians*. I came from computer science background, so I go for Python. In the future, Scala or Julia might gain more grounds, but they would be easier to migrate to from Python side, than from the R side. R is like an Microsoft Windows. Once you are onboard onto Visual C++ or VB platform, you will rise and fall with Microsoft only, and miss so many good thing from Unix to Linux.

The battle between R and Python also reminds me something about ICT convergence. To me, ICT convergence does not seem more challenging to Telecom operators than to vendors like Huawei, Ericsson. Telecom carriers used to spend huge amount of money buying all different proprietary, *expensive* and *siloed* softwares, including sales (salesforce vs amdocs), billing ( ? vs Huawei/Ericsson), Core Network (? vs Ericsson/Huawei), etc. This was not an issue when the business was booming, since you always have new money to buy another software to cover the previous wrong deals. However, with 3G, 4G Mobile BroadBand (MBB), OTT players (facebook, Youtube) dorminanted human communication field and drained out Telco's cash flow. Then Telcos must evaluate every investment carefully. Low-cost and standard softwares come on stage finnally.


For R, I leart quite a lot from those 2 sites:
* [Applied Predictive Modeling](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51156277e4b0b8b2ffe11c00/t/53ad86e5e4b0b52e4e71cfab/1403881189332/Applied_Predictive_Modeling_in_R.pdf)
* [R Tutorial](http://www.theanalysisfactor.com/resources/by-topic/r/)

For Python, 


# Python
There are many excellent free materials of learning Python. Here is a short list of the ones I found useful:
