# Background
When starting a new mining project, the first major decision is which tool or platform to use. Starting from a wrong choice may waste quite some time. 

When I was working on my PhD program, I started from Matlab. The reason was because of a project assignment from the Numerical Optimization class. No doubt that Matlab is a good matrix manipulation and numerical computation language. However its problem is that it is quite expensive, and yet not very easy to use.

After I graduated and was facing real life challenges, I regretted deeply about this choice because my favorite tool is not with me anymore. For thousands of times, I dreamed that if I have been using Python or R in my dissertation project, I would have been a better Data Scientist now. 

To make thing worse, even with Matlab, implementing a Churn Prediction Model is still much more challenging than doing so by Python or R. Simply by google searching, you can find way more sample codes implementing this in R or Python. For example, simply use google to search "Matlab Churn Prediction", "R Churn Prediction" or "Python Churn Prediction". You will get a good quality sample program in Python/Scikit-learn:
* [Predicting customer churn with scikit-learn](http://blog.yhat.com/posts/predicting-customer-churn-with-sklearn.html)

For R you might find and like:
* [Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry Using ](https://www.erpublication.org/admin/vol_issue1/upload%20Image/IJETR032129.pdf)

For Matlab, you get some documents and you still left with 70% of puzzle to put together by yourself.



# Open Source vs Commercial
Though people hear Big Data as a fuzzy word, most of times, their data value may not worth the price of a SAS, Matlab or SPSS software license. Not to mention the learning or training cost for any of those. 

Market is ruthless. Because they are proprietary softwares, if they fail in competition, you are in risk of losing your competency. I know quite some old engineers who were master of Infomix, DB2, VisualBasic, etc.   On the contrary, if you master of R or Python, this tool will be with you forever.

I choose only open source technologies. In the open source world, choices are plenty, and there must be one fitting your need. This book will focus on using Python based libraries. 


# Python vs R
First of all, R is awesome. But it's just not my type. 
After a few months, I have a feeling: *Python is for programmers and R is for statisticians*. I came from computer science background, so I go for Python. In the future, Scala or Julia might gain more grounds, but they would be easier to migrate to from Python side, than from the R side. R is like an Microsoft Windows. Once you are onboard onto Visual C++ or VB platform, you will rise and fall with Microsoft only, and miss so many good thing from Unix to Linux.

The battle between R and Python also reminds me something about ICT convergence. To me, ICT convergence does not seem more challenging to Telecom operators than to vendors like Huawei, Ericsson. Telecom carriers used to spend huge amount of money buying all different proprietary, *expensive* and *siloed* softwares, including sales (salesforce vs amdocs), billing ( ? vs Huawei/Ericsson), Core Network (? vs Ericsson/Huawei), etc. This was not an issue when the business was booming, since you always have new money to buy another software to cover the previous wrong deals. However, with 3G, 4G Mobile BroadBand (MBB), OTT players (facebook, Youtube) dorminanted human communication field and drained out Telco's cash flow. Then Telcos must evaluate every investment carefully. Low-cost and standard softwares come on stage finnally.


For R, I leart quite a lot from those 2 sites:
* [Applied Predictive Modeling](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51156277e4b0b8b2ffe11c00/t/53ad86e5e4b0b52e4e71cfab/1403881189332/Applied_Predictive_Modeling_in_R.pdf)
* [R Tutorial](http://www.theanalysisfactor.com/resources/by-topic/r/)

For Python, there are many excellent free materials. Here is a short list of the ones I found useful:
* [Python Tutorial](http://www.pythondoc.com/pythontutorial3/index.html#)
* [Tutorialspoint](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm)
* [Quantecon Python Doc](http://quant-econ.net/py/index.html)
* Whenever I have trouble, I always paste error code to google and it leads me to stackoverflow. I love stackoverflow.

I said many good things about Python. The only thing I hate about Python is Version 2 to Version 3 disruption. It was completely unnecessary and suicidal as a language. Maybe there are good reasons, but I never run into the benefits.
