# Background
When starting a new mining project, the first major decision is which tool or platform to use. Starting from a wrong choice may waste quite some time. 

When I was working on my PhD program, I started from Matlab. The reason was because of a project assignment from the Numerical Optimization class. No doubt that Matlab is a good matrix manipulation and numerical computation language. However its problem is that it is quite expensive, yet not very easy to use.

Choices are plenty, and there must be one fitting your need. This book will focus on using Python based libraries. 

# Open Source vs Commercial
Though people hear Big Data as a fuzzy word, most of times, their data value may not worth the price of a SAS, Matlab or SPSS software license. Not to mention the learning or training cost for any of those. 

Market is ruthless. Because they are proprietary softwares, if they fail in competition, you are in risk of losing your competency. I know quite some old engineers who were master of Infomix, DB2, VisualBasic, etc.   On the contrary, if you master of R or Python, this tool will be with you forever.


# Python vs R

Python is for programmers and R is for statisticians.

# Python
There are many excellent free materials of learning Python. Here is a short list of the ones I found useful:
